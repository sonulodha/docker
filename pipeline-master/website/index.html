						<div class="content">
							<p>The word photography derives from the Greek photos ("light") and graphe ("drawing"). The term was coined by Hercules Florence, a French painter and inventor, who used it in his diary to describe the process. Photos is also the root of words such as photon or photophobia (fear of light). </p>
							<p>Photography is the art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication </p>
							<p>What is photography? One place to look for the answer is a dictionary. The online version of the Oxford English Dictionary describes photography as ‘the art or practice of taking and processing photographs’. Let make it a little more specific: ‘the art or process of producing images by the action of radiant energy and especially light on a sensitive surface (as film or an optical sensor)’. </p>
							<p>I’m grateful to photography as it has helped me make a living for the last four years. I started working as a writer for EOS magazine, then turned freelance a little over two years ago. I run a successful business and that’s very empowering. Photography is a journey, on both personal and literal levels, and I’m looking forward to finding out where it will take me next.</p>

								<h3>What Photography Means To Me </h3>
								<p>To me, photography is an art of observation. It’s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place… I’ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them..</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="spotlight alt">
							<div class="image flush"><img src="images/p7.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<div  class="inner">
								<h3>What Is A Photograph</h3>
								<p>“A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches the heart and leaves the viewer a changed person for having seen it. It is, in a word, effective.”</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="spotlight">
							<div class="image flush"><img src="images/p8.jpg" alt="" /></div>
							<div class="inner">
								<h3>The Power of Photographer</h3>
								<p>If the photographer is interested in the people in front of his lens, and if he is compassionate, it’s already a lot. The instrument is not the camera but the photographer.</p>
